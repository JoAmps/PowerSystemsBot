# Project Objective
PowerSystem Bot is a web application aimed at assisting electrical engineering master's students in their studies. With the complexity of power system protection concepts, it's crucial to provide an interactive platform that facilitates quick access to relevant information.

Using cutting-edge large language model(LLM) techniques, PowerSystem Bot offers a question and answering interface that allows students to effortlessly find answers to their queries. The bot leverages a database of electrical engineering knowledge in the form of the lecture notes, to provide accurate and detailed responses.

By utilizing this platform, students can save time and effort by typing their questions directly, eliminating the need to search through lengthy PDF documents. PowerSystem Bot serves as a valuable educational tool, empowering students to enhance their understanding and excel in their power system protection studies.

With PowerSystem Bot, students can efficiently navigate the complexities of electrical engineering, receive immediate responses to their inquiries, and foster a productive and engaging learning experience in the field of power system protection.
